Why I Love Tomatoes 
27.8.2018

I love tomatoes because they are red and round. Tomatoes are similar to apples, but unlike apples tomatoes come in one color - red. And red is the best color a tomato could get. It suits tomato, makes it look good in the face of any life circumstances. Even in a salad.  

Also tomatoes are soft. This means that if someone throws a tomato at you, it won't hurt and negatively affect the relationship you have with the one who throws. I would strongly recommend to use tomatoes as a weapon of choice when having a fight with loved ones. The fight would quickly turn into a funny game similar to the one you used to play in childhood and make your emotional bonds even stronger.

The best thing about tomato that it makes a splash. It fires a charge of red juice in every direction at once making everything look nicer. White men shirts and women dresses become more fashionable when touched with tomato juice. It makes you really stand out from the crowd. So if you don't have a tomato in your home, go buy one!
