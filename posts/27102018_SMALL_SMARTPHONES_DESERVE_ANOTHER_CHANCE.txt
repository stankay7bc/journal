SMALL SMARTPHONES DESERVE ANOTHER CHANCE

Smartphones are getting bigger. Manufacturers impose this on customers. But technology can provide more value in less space. Imagine a phone the size of iPhone 4. With good performance, good camera, simple user interface and which can do following:

* Communication
  - voice and text 
* Navigation 
  - public transit and taxi
* Payments 
  - NFC wallet
* Photo and video
  - camera with flashlight
* Fitness 
  - step and distance counter, active time tracker
* Entertainment 
  - music streaming
  - simple games like Snake or any puzzles

Right now there are only two options that fit - the Iphone SE and Sony Xperia XZ2 Compact. Both will become obsolete really soon and no new similar phones on the horizon. So, please, LET SMALL PHONES LIVE!
